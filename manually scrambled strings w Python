##The most simple method (that I could create) of manualy scrambling strings using Python - as
##apposed to using the built-in shuffle() method. I could not find this on
##the internet so I had to make it. Feel free to use it however you wish.


from random import randint 

def scrambleWord(userWord):
    lst = list(userWord)#convert userWord to list so it can be manipulated
    #print(lst) test to see if converted to list
    for index in range(len(lst)):
        ranIndex = randint(0,len(userWord)-1)#random index within len of word
        ranPosition = lst[ranIndex]#random position using a random index from word
        lst.pop(ranIndex) #remove the randomly selected positions so they are not printed twice
        lst.insert(0,ranPosition)#re-insert
              
    print(''.join(lst))


def main():
    userWord = input("Enter the word: ") 
    scrambleWord(userWord)
main()
